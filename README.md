## Types of Study
There are many ways in which data can be collected in order to test or understand the relationship between two variables of interest. These methods can be put into three main bins, based on the amount of control that you hold over the variables in play:</br>

 1.If you have a lot of control over features, then you have an experiment.</br>
 2.If you have no control over the features, then you have an observational study.</br>
 3.If you have some control, then you have a quasi-experiment.</br>
 
While the experiment is the main focus of this course, it's also useful to know about the other types of study so that you can use them in effective ways, especially if an experiment cannot be run.
